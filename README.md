# TDD Question

In Test Driven Development an automated test is written before the implementation.
The automated test should initially fail, proving the system is not working as required and missing functionality.
Code should then be added that will make the test pass, proving the code functions as intended.

In this repo there is a test project, which contains 12 tests for a class called `LetterToNumberConverter`, which is yet to be implemented.
This class should covert letters into numbers, for example `A` converts to `1`, `Z` converts to `26`, `AA` converts to `27` and so on.

Write an implementation to make all of the tests pass.

## Setup

You should fork the repo, clone that to your machine and create a new branch with your solution

```git
git clone https://github.com/{yourusername}/TDD-Question.git
git checkout -b feature/{yourname}
```
